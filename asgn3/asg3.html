    NOTES FOR GRADER:
    <br>
    <br>
    <li>WASD: move</li>
    <li>Q/E: pan left/right</li>
    <li>Z/X: extend/retract wire (place and remove block)</li>
    <li>Mouse: look around</li>
    <br>
    <br>
    RUBRIC - wow:
    <li>Wrote my own obj loader, for objects like the eye, the wire, and the plug (also loads uv coordinates)</li>
    <li>Learned about cubemaps for a seemingly infinite skybox</li>
    <li>Shader effects, including basic N-Dot-L lighting, time-based coloring, and posterization</li>
    <li>P.S. the eye is always looking at you</li>
    <br>
    <br>
    RUBRIC - story:
    <br>
    <br>
    Under constant judgement, you are tasked with the burden of achievement.
    <br>
    Plug in the wires into the sockets for the final accomplishment. 
    <br>
    If you even can.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    RUBRIC - requirements:
    <li>Different texture images for the sky, eye, and wires. Vertex color for wires and ground (there is a ground cube, I promise)</li>
    <br>
    <br>
